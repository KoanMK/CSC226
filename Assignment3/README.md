## ASSIGNMENT 3

## A3 Written

Theoretical portion of assignment three.
Includes proofs regarding graph theory, shortest path algorithms such as Dijkstra's and the Bellman-Ford algorithms.

## ShortestPath.java

Java implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path from a source to all other vertices.
Reads adjacency matrices and outputs the weight of the path to each other node.
Overall time complexity of O(n^2).

## Graphs.txt

Testing graphs for ShortestPath.java.

Overall, content could have been more thorough. I did what I could, however, given the constraints I had at that time.
